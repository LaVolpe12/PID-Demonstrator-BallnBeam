Project Overview

Welcome! In this repository, you will find all the STL files required to 3D print and recreate this project at your convenience. All STL files are available for free download, allowing you to bring this project to life with your 3D printer.

Important Notes:

- While the STL files are provided, please note that bolts, nuts, and other necessary hardware must be purchased separately.
- Feel free to use these files for personal projects or as inspiration for your own creations.
Arduino Code

Additionally, I’ve included the Arduino code that powers the project. Whether you're looking to replicate the project or simply study and learn from the code, you are welcome to make use of it.

Usage:

The code is available for rebuilding the project or can serve as a helpful reference to analyze and learn how it works.

License and Permissions:

You are free to download, modify, and use both the 3D models and the Arduino code. While no restrictions are placed on usage, I’d appreciate credit for the original design and code if used in your own projects or shared publicly.

Enjoy exploring the project, and happy printing and coding!

Adriano and Ferdianad :)
